I created an interface that makes it easy for non-developers to view and interact with information stored in my database. I built a solution for managing a company's employees using node, inquirer, and MySQL.

I designed a database schema which is in this repo  The user will be able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in their company so that they can organize and plan their business.


The following are instructions to start the app:

Go to schema.sql in the Assetts folder.
Copy the schema and paste it into sql.
create the db. and rows
Go to the employeeTrackingSystem.js and open the terminal
Enter into the terminal npm install
Once the install is complete, type node/nodemon server.js
Then the App will open up and start asking you questions.
